# Prework-Study-Guide Website

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
    - I wanted to create a strong foundation and familiarize myself with the basics so I'm prepared heading into week 1 of the boot camp!
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
    - This project is giving me the baseline to hit the ground running during the boot camp. It's also allowing me to not only keep detailed notes, but keep them in a way that is relevant to the subject matter of the boot camp.
- What problem does it solve?
    - It keeps me organized and keeps all notes in one concise place. It also helps me use what I'm learning in real-time to keep these notes.
- What did you learn?
    - I learned a multitude of beginning elements for this boot camp from the prework-study-guide project. HTML, CSS, Java, Github basics, etc. All of which will contribute to a concrete foundation entering week 1 of the NW boot camp!

The 3 main elements we learned throughout this prework study guide are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Each one has its own important role in the foundation, aesthetics, and usage of this website. Throughout the website you'll see that each element has its own section with comprehensive notes regarding each element. Referring back to this website will continue to ground me in the basics of coding while we begin this boot camp journey!
